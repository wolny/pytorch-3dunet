# pytorch-3dunet

PyTorch implementation of a standard 3D U-Net based on:

[3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric Segmentation from Sparse Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650) 
Özgün Çiçek et al.

as well as Residual 3D U-Net based on:

[Superhuman Accuracy on the SNEMI3D Connectomics Challenge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.00120.pdf) Kisuk Lee et al.

## Prerequisites
- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA CuDNN

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- python (3.7+)
- pytorch (1.0+)
- torchvision (0.2.1+)
- tensorboardx (1.6+)
- h5py
- scipy 
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn (0.21+)
- pytest
- hdbscan (0.8.22+)

Setup a new conda environment (Python 3.7+) with required dependencies via:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
``` 
Activate newly created conda environment via:
```
source activate 3dunet
```

## Supported model architectures
- in order to train standard 3D U-Net specify `name: UNet3D` in the `model` section of the [config file](resources/train_config_ce.yaml)
- in order to train Residual U-Net specify `name: ResidualUNet3D` in the `model` section of the [config file](resources/train_config_ce.yaml)

## Supported Loss Functions
For a detailed explanation of the loss functions used see:
[Generalised Dice overlap as a deep learning loss function for highly unbalanced segmentations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03237.pdf)
Carole H. Sudre, Wenqi Li, Tom Vercauteren, Sebastien Ourselin, M. Jorge Cardoso

- _WeightedCrossEntropyLoss_ (see 'Weighted cross-entropy (WCE)' in the above paper for a detailed explanation; one can specify class weights via `weight: [w_1, ..., w_k]` in the `loss` section of the config)
- _CrossEntropyLoss_ (one can specify class weights via `weight: [w_1, ..., w_k]` in the `loss` section of the config)
- _PixelWiseCrossEntropyLoss_ (one can specify not only class weights but also per pixel weights in order to give more/less gradient in some regions of the ground truth)
- _BCEWithLogitsLoss_
- _DiceLoss_ standard Dice loss (see 'Dice Loss' in the above paper for a detailed explanation).
- _GeneralizedDiceLoss_ (see 'Generalized Dice Loss (GDL)' in the above paper for a detailed explanation; one can specify class weights via `weight: [w_1, ..., w_k]` in the `loss` section of the config). 
Note: use this loss function only if the labels in the training dataset are very imbalanced
e.g. one class having at lease 3 orders of magnitude more voxels than the others. Otherwise use standard _DiceLoss_ which works better than GDL most of the time. 


## Supported Evaluation Metrics
- **MeanIoU** - Mean intersection over union
- **DiceCoefficient** - Dice Coefficient (computes per channel Dice Coefficient and returns the average)
- **BoundaryAveragePrecision** - Average Precision (normally used for evaluating instance segmentation, however it can be used when the 3D UNet is used to predict the boundary signal from the instance segmentation ground truth)
- **AdaptedRandError** - Adapted Rand Error (see http://brainiac2.mit.edu/SNEMI3D/evaluation for a detailed explanation)

If not specified `MeanIoU` will be used by default.

## Train
E.g. fit to randomly generated 3D volume and random segmentation mask from [random_label3D.h5](resources/label3d/random_label3D.h5) run:
```
python train.py --config resources/train_config_ce.yaml # train with CrossEntropyLoss
```
or:

```
python train.py --config resources/train_config_dice.yaml # train with DiceLoss
```

See the [train_config_ce.yaml](resources/train_config_ce.yaml) for more info.

In order to train on your own data just provide the paths to your HDF5 training and validation datasets in the [train_config_ce.yaml](resources/train_config_ce.yaml).
The HDF5 files should contain the raw/label data sets in the following axis order: `DHW` (in case of 3D) `CDHW` (in case of 4D).

Monitor progress with Tensorboard `tensorboard --logdir ./3dunet/logs/ --port 8666` (you need `tensorflow` installed in your conda env).

### Training tips
1. In order to train with `BCEWithLogitsLoss`, `DiceLoss` or `GeneralizedDiceLoss` the label data has to be 4D (one target binary mask per channel).
If you have a 3D binary data (foreground/background), you can just change `ToTensor` transform for the label to contain `expand_dims: true`, see e.g. [train_config_dice.yaml](resources/train_config_dice.yaml).

2. When training with binary-based losses (`BCEWithLogitsLoss`, `DiceLoss`, `GeneralizedDiceLoss`) `final_sigmoid=True` has to be present in the training config, since every output channel gives the probability of the foreground.
When training with cross entropy based losses (`WeightedCrossEntropyLoss`, `CrossEntropyLoss`, `PixelWiseCrossEntropyLoss`) set `final_sigmoid=False` so that `Softmax` normalization is applied to the output.

## Test
Test on randomly generated 3D volume (just for demonstration purposes) from [random_label3D.h5](resources/label3d/random_label3D.h5). 
```
python predict.py --config resources/test_config_ce.yaml
```
or if you trained with `DiceLoss`:
```
python predict.py --config resources/test_config_dice.yaml
```
Prediction masks will be saved to `resources/random_label3D_probabilities.h5`.

In order to predict your own raw dataset provide the path to your model as well as paths to HDF5 test datasets in the [test_config_ce.yaml](resources/test_config_ce.yaml).

### Prediction tips
In order to avoid block artifacts in the output prediction masks the patch predictions are averaged, so make sure that `patch/stride` params lead to overlapping blocks, e.g. `patch: [64 128 128] stride: [32 96 96]` will give you a 'halo' of 32 voxels in each direction.
